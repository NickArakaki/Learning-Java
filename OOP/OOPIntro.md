# About OOP

- An object is two things
  1. a collection of data that represents a real-world concept
  2. behavior, represented by an object's methods

# Classes

- the definitions of stat and behavior are stored in a class
- a class is a contract, it specifies the data that makes up each object instance
- a class is a composite data type, made up of other data types
  can be created from primitive data types or other classes
